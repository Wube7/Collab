# Snake Rendering Task

## Description
Create and display the snake on the game board.

## Requirements
- Define snake data structure to track position and segments
- Render snake on canvas using appropriate styling
- Initial snake should have a starting length (typically 3-5 segments)
- Snake should be clearly visible against the background

## Acceptance Criteria
- Snake appears on the game board at the start position
- Snake segments are properly connected
- Snake is rendered with distinct styling (color, border, etc.)
- Data structure properly represents snake position and length

## Notes
- Consider using an array of coordinates to track snake segments
- Each segment should be the same size (e.g., 20x20 pixels)
- Head of the snake might have a different color/style to differentiate it
