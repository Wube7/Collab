# Food Generation Task

## Description
Implement the functionality to randomly generate food items on the game board for the snake to eat.

## Requirements
- Create a function to randomly place food on the board
- Ensure food doesn't appear on the snake's current position
- Food should be visually distinct from the snake and background
- New food should be generated when the previous one is eaten

## Acceptance Criteria
- Food appears at random positions on the board
- Food never spawns on top of the snake
- Food is visually distinguishable from other elements
- New food appears immediately after the current one is eaten

## Notes
- Consider using a different shape or color for food
- Random position should be aligned with the grid system
- Position calculation should consider the boundaries of the game board
