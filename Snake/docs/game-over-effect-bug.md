# Game Over Effect Bug

## Bug Description
When the game ends and the player clicks 'Play Again' to restart, the red game over effect was not being reset, causing the game to remain with a red color theme.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Start a new game
2. Play until game over
3. Observe the red visual effect that appears when game over occurs
4. Click "Play Again"
5. Notice that the red color theme persists even though the game has restarted

## Resolution
Fixed by adding code to reset visual effects in the startGame() function:

```javascript
// Reset visual effects
foodEatenEffect = false;
gameOverEffect = false;
gameOverRadius = 0;
```
